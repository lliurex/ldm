wwm 1.1.6 - mods by Scott Balneaves

Based on evilwm 0.3 by Ciaran Anscomb <ciarana@rd.bbc.co.uk>

wwm is a minimalist window manager for the X Window System, which is pretty
close to evilwm.

I first bumped into evilwm 6 or so years ago, and was thrilled.  It was
pretty much exactly what I wanted.  But not quite.

It started out fairly simply: I just wanted to change the border colours.
However, as time went on, I just sort of kept adding things here and there.
I kept an eye on evilwm's development, and as Ciaran fixed things, or
added things, I moved them into my tree.

I used wwm basically unchanged for about 4 years, but recently, I went
back and re-looked at evilwm again.  I liked the Makefile, and some of
the bug fixes, (i.e. the numlock fix) and so, I hacked around a bit, and
here I am.

wwm stands for "Wicked Window Manager", which is sort of a play on words,
as, since I've refined evilwm to my liking, wickedness is simply refined
evil.  Or something like that.

wwm has a few features added, and a few taken away that I didn't use.

FEATURES ADDED:

 * Different keymaping method to make it easier to change keymaps.
 * "passthrough" keystrokes.  For example, alt-f is "bring forward" in wwm,
   but if you press alt-v, alt-f, the alt-f keystroke is passed through to
   the application.
 * If you've got a scrolly-wheel mouse, scrolling on the root window changes
   vdesks.
 * You can resize a window horizontally (in 16 pixel increments) with alt-u
   and alt-p and vertically with alt-i and alt-o.
 * alt-m maximizes both horizontally and vertically.


 * No window decorations apart from a simple 2 pixel border.
 * No icons.
 * Good keyboard control
 * Box window drags
 * Virtual desktops
 * Small binary size (~16k!)
 * Scrolly wheel mouse desktop changes
 * passthrough keyboard grabs.

INSTALLATION

Compile and copy the wwm executable to wherever you'd like

CONTROLS

You can use the mouse to manipulate windows either by click/dragging
the 2 pixel border, or by holding down Meta1 (The "ALT" key)
and doing so anywhere in the client window.  The controls are:

Button 1    Move window
Button 3    Resize window

All keyboard controls are used by holding down Meta1 ("ALT" key), then
pressing a key.  Available functions are:

Return      Spawn new xterm
Escape      Delete current window
b           Lower current window (fore)
f           raise current window (back)
x           Maximize window horizontally
y           Maximize window vertically
m           Maximize window fully
v           Passthrough
=           Fix or unfix current window
1 - 8       Switch virtual desktop
Tab         Rotate windows on the screen
Left        Rotate virtual desktop LEFT
Right       Rotate virtual desktop RIGHT
h,j,k,l     Move window 16 pixels
u,i,o,p     Resize window 16 pixels
[,],;,'     Position window top left, right, bottom left, right
End key     Exit wm


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The original code base for this project was that of aewm by Decklin
Foster.  His code is very clean and, in later versions, very well
commented.  I'd recommend it if you want to learn more about window
manager theory (or indeed want title bars, etc ;).
